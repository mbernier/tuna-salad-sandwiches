# Tuna Salad Sandwiches

## Ingredients

* Tuna pouches, like 4 of them
* Cut up some some parsley
* Half an avacado, or more if you want
* half a round tomato, chopped into square pieces
* 1/3 cup Mayo
* 1 Tbsp whole grain mustard
* lots of black pepper
* Cut a lemon, cuz that's how you roll, then squeeze his guts out
* Kosher salt, because Alton Brown puts it in everything
* Croissants

## Directions

In a small mixing bowl, squeeze the tuna out of the poutches that they were harvested in from nature. Break up the tuna with a fork. Toss with the celery and parsley. Add the mayonnaise, mustard and season with pepper and salt, to taste. Stir to combine. Toss in the tomatoes squares and avacado.

Add lemon juice, to taste, if using.

Slice the croissants how ever you want, but I suggest making them into two pieces like you would for a sandwich. Scoop some of that mess you made in the bowl onto the croissant.

Shove it in your face, don't forget to chew.

## Notes
The base recipe was from [FoodNetwork](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/tuna-salad-recipe/index.html), but you know how I do - I messed with it.
